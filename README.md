#CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

This repository contains my solutions to assignments of this course offered by Stanford University. **I did not attend Stanford University**. I just self-studied the course via videos available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLvH2FwAQhnpj1WEB-jHmPuUeQ8mX-XXG) and the [course website](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/).


##About Me
I work as a software engineer in Gurgaon, India and I am very curious about machine learning and artificial intelligence. I have been taking online courses to teach myself more about machine learning. As of November 2016, I have completed the [machine learning course offered by Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/).

I self-studied CS231n as a preparation for my next set of courses as a part of the [Udacity Self Driving Car Nano-degree](https://www.udacity.com/drive). I have been enrolled in the November 2016 batch.
